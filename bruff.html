            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                To end this year we had to create a project in groups from three words. 
                The three words we got were: Sobriety, Numeric and Rock'n Roll. We did 
                everything through the internet because of the Covid-19 so it wasn't always easy, 
                but we learnt to use tools like Miro to share ideas, Figma to design together, 
                Discord to talk, Trello to organised ourselves and Github to share our code.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Creative Directions</h3>

            <h4> 1/ How to create an intergenerational sharing of music? </h4>
            <p>
                Listening to music alone is surely great but, when you bring your parents or your grandparents, to listen to your favourite singers it's a kind of success. In addition, 
                it's a way to feel closer and ease the communication inside the household.
            </p>


            <h4> 2/ How to restrict the use of mobile phones during musical events as concerts and festivals?</h4>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.archyde.com/appearing-timidly-in-france-the-prohibition-of-mobile-phones-in-shows-is-spreading-in-the-united-states/" target="blank_">"So why did I lose 15 seconds of this beautiful moment to take a video that I will never watch?"</a> Andrew Bancroft.
                <br><br>
                We observed that during big events, especially concerts and festivals, 
                the view is polluted by screens and people can't fully enjoy the show. 
                Our idea was to create an app that blocked the phone during a span of time. 
                The topic is how to get people to use that kind of app? And what if they have an emergency?
                <br><br>
                We finally chose the second option because we liked the conflict between a phone app and a willingness to pull away our phones.
            </p>

            <h3>Imagine functions</h3>
            <h4>3 Levels of restriction</h4>
            <p>
                To adapt the app for each user we created 3 Levels of restriction during de festival. <br> <br>

                Level 1: The user can take 20 photos, 3 videos and can call and message 10 contacts. <br>
                Level 2: The user can take 10 photos, 1 video and can contact 5 people. <br>
                Level 3: This time no photo or video and only 2 contacts for emergency.
            </p>

            <h4>Participatory video</h4>
            <p>
                If the user accepts to participate he will receive a notification during the event. 
                During a short determined time he will have to film. After the event, all the videos 
                will be put together in a movie. We will then be able to watch the entire event or 
                select a specific moment thanks to the timeline.
            </p>

            <h4>Connected people</h4>
            <p>
                When we are not in an event the app works as a social network that connects people 
                interested in the same festival. Each event generates a specific community space to 
                talk about the future event, pull them together. And they may meet in real life, 
                without their phone in between.
            </p>

            <h3>Finding a good name</h3>
            <p>
                Our theme was Rock'n Roll, in this case we wanted something new, nonconformist and funny. 
                So we thought of a phrase. After a few propositions we found the phrase: "Broke Your Fucking Phone". 
                But it wasn't enough, and the name was way too long. So after some changes and many spelling 
                errors we ended with our great "B'Rock Ur Fucking Fone" or BRUFF.
            </p>

            <h3>The future of BRUFF</h3>
            <p>
                For the future of our app we can imagine that the app would be use in every type of event 
                all around the world. A real community of people using BRUFF can be created and many 
                users can meet in real life.

            <h3>What did I learn ?</h3>
            <p>
                This project made me use many software I didn't know. Furthermore, now I know better 
                how to be more effective and how to use better the tools we learned at our school such 
                as wireframes, and user flow. I also know that I can code simple things pretty fast and 
                what are my personal limits.
