            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>We first began to question the good habits we can take at home. And by doing a brainstorming we found the problem of sleep. 
                The sleep quality of French people is decreasing more and more every year and the covid crisis didn’t help. It’s really 
                difficult to have good sleep habits since the development of smartphones. The distraction and the blue light are taking us awake. 
                So, how can we create an object that can help us create a good sleep routine?
                 </p>

            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Karo’s an alarm clock and a lamp connected to an app. On it, the user can set up his night. When it’s time to go in his bed he’ll 
                be notified and the lamp will light on. If the phone is less than 5 meters from the clock, the light will blink. The phone needs 
                to be kept away. Until sleeping time the intensity of the light will decrease. The light will blink slowly two times to alert 
                the moment the user should sleep. Karo has clickable touchpad that allows severals interactions: touching it permit to show the time, 
                clicking on it light on/off the lamp, sliding up makes the intensity go higher when sliding down makes it go lower.  Karo collects 
                data on the user’s sleep thanks to a microphone and send them to the app in the morning. Thanks to this analysis the user is 
                waking up at the end of a sleep cycle. At that best time, the music volume and the light will increase slowly. Tapping twice on the 
                touchpad stop the alarm. On the app their’s a report of the night.
            
            </p>

            <h3>Conception process</h3>
            <p>
                After we agreed on what our concept was, we did researches by questioning people to list what prevents them to sleep. 
                The principal issue we saw was the phone and its distractions. In reaction to this, we searched for a way to keep phones 
                away with a light that reacts when the phone is too close. We researched the existing apps of smart alarm clocks that encourage 
                a good sleep routine. But also on every type of alarm clock and in the art field to see how the sleep was pictured. After 
                determined each functionality of our alarm clock and our app, we worked on the shape. We decided to do a simple sphere 
                that could diffuse light with good intensity. You just have to lift it to change the light bulb. We loved the physical 
                aspect of an interrupter so we choose to put a touchpad. We decided to choose nuances of purple to create a night 
                atmosphere for the app and the logo. We worked on blender and Keyshot to make the 3D model and on Figma for the interfaces.

            <h3>The name</h3>
            <p>
                The name Karo comes from a homonymous people from Ethiopia where men travel with a little headrest to be able to sleep everywhere.

            <h3>Keep the bad waves away</h3>
            <p>
                Karo is an alarm clock but also a real lamp that provides sufficient light to read. It’s a smart alarm clock, 
                connected to an app that makes it easy to take control of our sleep habits. It helps us to have a regular sleep 
                away from screens. By keeping away from our phones we also keep away bad waves. The alarm clock is connected 
                to the wifi to determine the distance from the phone and sending data to it. However, this connexion is off 
                when the user is sleeping to limit the bad waves. The data are conserved in the alarm clock until morning. 
                Analyses worked with a microphone. A ring unable us turn off the microphone by turning the ring.

            <h3>Future development</h3>
            <p>
                To go further we should build our alarm clock and test it on real users to have feedback on their experience. 
                The ideal would be that the frustration of not having a phone in bed decreases with time. We also would like 
                to see if we need to add functionalities such as the implementation of an emergency contact list for people 
                afraid to miss an important call at night.

            <h3>Competitions</h3>
            <p>
                Our project have also been presenting in the <a href="https://www.globalgradshow.com/">Global Grad Show</a> competition.
