            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>This project was carried out in 1 week during a workshop. The title of the workshop
                was "Creative code" and we had to create something we could interact with.
                At first our group wanted to work on augmented reality, but soon we found out
                that we were more interested in the conception of an interactive creature.
            </p>


            <h3>How did we work?</h3>
            <p>
                In a project like this one two points are truly important: having a good structure
                and never losing motivation. With this target in mind, we established a vote to make decisions,
                as well as a list of goals for each day. Then we found our mascot Totoro that we granted to
                the person who was really getting discouraged. Before all, what kept us motivated all along
                the project was our success board, on which we wrote every success big or little.
            </p>

            <h3>Phone to computer</h3>
            <p>
                When we first thought about Kyū we got the following words: interactive animal, mobile phone
                (sensor), screen, animations, sounds and design. This was what we had to do to give life to Kyū.
                Our first goal was to learn how to use the sensors of our phone to interact with the computer.
                <br><br>
                We tested two software: <a href="https://tramontana.xyz/"> Tramontana</a> and <a
                    href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hollyhook.oscHook&hl=en_US"> oscHook</a>.
                We found how to move a cube on the computer screen by using the accelerometer from OSCHook
                and adopted this software. Then we determined each status of the phone and we wrote a code in
                processing.
                This code was the basis of everything else. For each status of the phone the colour on the computer
                changed.

            <h3>Creation of a creature</h3>

            <h4>Definition of the character</h4>
            <p>
                For 10 minutes we all wrote on Post-it to define the main character traits of our creature.
                We did the same for its shape and its actions. Then, we voted and the result was that our
                creature would be a joyful cute and fearful sphere that can roll, sleep, split itself
                (later we added the teleportation).
            </p>

            <h4>Try out of textures</h4>
            <p>
                For the "skin" of Kyū we tested a lot of textures. We thought that a texture would make it more real.
                In the end, we picked out the picture of a pink and blue candyfloss.
            </p>

            <img src="./img/projects/kyu/texture.jpg" alt="">

            <h4>Build a house for it</h4>
            <p>
                This creature couldn't float in anything so we established a mood board to find the right universe.
                We were touched by universes like "Adventure Time" or "Star vs. The Evil Forces" and space in general.
                Then we tried different things on illustrator until we found the proper one: between space and magic.
            </p>

            <img src="./img/projects/kyu/univers_kyu.jpg" alt="final background">

            <h4>Find a good name</h4>
            <p>
                On the board everyone was able to write a name we liked. The final name was found by searching in
                Google.
                We tried to translate "sphere" in different languages and in Japanese Google gave us "Kyū".
                Kyū (級) doesn't mean "sphere" but "steps in a ceremony or in a progression".
                We liked the idea that Kyū was the main step in our progression to become good interaction designers.
            </p>

            <h3>Let's animate!</h3>
            <p>
                After the creation of a sphere in Blender we found out how to animate the deconstruction of this object.
                Then we begun to rewrite the code to produce what we wanted to do.
                It wasn't easy but we got our 7 states and just had to bring together all pieces of code.
            </p>

            <h3>Its first sound!</h3>
            <p>
                Kyū was then only a sphere moving in a background, but we decided to add sounds.
                Enora did the voice, I did the background music and we mixed the sounds with Audacity.
                We were eventually able to see Kyū's personality.
            </p>

            <h3>The final touch</h3>
            <p>
                For the end of the workshop we had to submit our project. We used a big screen,
                a plaid, stuffed animals and coloured lights to represent the cute universe of Kyū.
            </p>

            <h3>What did I learned</h3>
            <p>
                Before this workshop I didn't thing that I was capable of something like this.
                We had a lot of autonomy and it was really great to consider a way to stay organised
                and motivated. I'm really proud of this project and it was great and fun to work with all.
                Today, I know how to use Tramontana and OSCHook. I also have the feeling that I'm capable of anything.
            </p>
