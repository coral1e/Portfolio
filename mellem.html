            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>Between 3 and 6 years old children are in their preoperative phase. 
                It means that they become self-aware and became to say «I». 
                But they are slaved by their emotions and need to learn how to control them.

                With their parents, children are very empathetic and mimic them a lot. 
                Then, if one of the parents yells when they are angry the child will do the same. And if the parents are really sad the child 
                will be very sad too. In that case, parents need to be aware of that to learn 
                how to control themself next to their child.
                 </p>

            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>Mellem is an interactive plush that helps children understand and control their emotions. It has a connected app that allows 
                parents to follow the progress of their children. They also have access to articles that advise to help their children.
                I sewed a big plush that the child can carry like a backpack. Its face is a screen, and it has a big pocket in the front 
                to put objects such as an angry cushion or pencil and paper to enable the child to express his emotions.  
            </p>

            <img src="./img/projects/mellem/mellem.1.png" alt="picture of mellem">

            <h3>How it’s working?</h3>
            <p>Mellem will propose 4 types of activities to fill 4 gauges: 

                To improve empathy Mellem will tell a story and ask the child how he thinks one of the characters feels in a selected situation.
                
                To help the child recognize emotions Mellem will play emotion and ask the child to find which one it is. Or it will ask him to imitate him.
                
                Finally, if the child has a really strong emotion Mellem will see that with its camera and will propose to him to use the angry cushion if his angry or talk to him.

            </p>

            <h3>Material and security</h3>
            <p>
                Because it's for the children the security is necessary. In that case nor the microphone or the camera is connected to the internet. The analyses of the emotions are done inside of Mellem. 
                It will send a number that represents an emotion and will be translated by the secured app.

            </p>

            <h3>Mellem</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to his screen Mellem is able to have a lot of facial emotions.

            <h3>The name</h3>
            <p>
                Mellem means «between» in danish. It's also a palindromic word. I choose this name because I didn’t want the plush the replace the parents but to be a new link between them. 
                It's a relation that need to be both way between parents and child.           

            </p>

            <h3>An app for the parents</h3>
            <p>
                The app allows parents to take some time questioning their own emotions. The emotions of the family are tracked to being able to see if there is any correlation between them.

                Parents can see at any time the emotion of the child, its activity, and its progress. The parents are notified of their child’s emotions only if he accepts to send them or if it’s regular because it can be dangerous.

                They also have access to articles about emotions and how to help their child with them.
