            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>At the beginning of our first year as interaction student we had to learn how to code. 
                The Patatap was our first project and we learned to code via P5JS. The idea for a Patatap 
                is to created visual animations based on a sound for every letter of the keyboard. 
                Your keyboard is your instrument. We had to find everything: a theme, some sounds, 
                the animations.
                 </p>

            <h3>What about the Theme?</h3>
            <p>I really like music, so this project was dedicated to me, and shortly after the beginning 
                of it I fell in love with an instrument named kalimba and decided to make all the sounds with my it. 
                Its soothing sound led me to set up my Patatap with Japanese theme. Listening to my kalimba I imagined a 
                Japanese garden so I tried to recreate it.
            </p>

            <h3>I had to choose colours</h3>
            <p>Because for me, and according to their flag, the Japanese's colours are red and white, 
                I began with them and I added green and blue for the bamboos and the water in the garden. 
                The background is a grey that let us clearly see every animations (which was not the case with black).

            </p>

            <h3>The animations</h3>
            <p>For the animations the teacher gave us some examples of basic animations that we learnt together and 
                after this I spend a lot of time modifying them to generate my own animations. This is what I liked the most 
                about this project, I was able to create, search, try, everything I wanted. I was sad to end my Patatap project, 
                but I'm proud of my first coding experience.
                <br><br>
                I imagined animations based on my theme so we can see a Torii (traditional gate), some bamboos, white flowers, 
                lanterns, "Japan" written in Japanese and other patterns I found during my experiments. At the end, we can see 
                that my inspiration was calling for some foods and I animated Onigiris, Sushis and Dangos.
