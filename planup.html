            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>During my first year of my Master, I did an Erasmus in the Netherlands. I went to Windesheim in Zwolle and
                attend a class named
                Concept and Creation. The goal was to create and develop a project in a multidisciplinary team. We had
                to design, develop and
                think of how to market it. During what they called the Dragon's Den we had to defend our concept in
                front of professionals.
            </p>

            <h3>Our idea</h3>
            <p>Planup is a mobile app to help students in their homework planning. The user just has to write the task
                they need to do, select
                the tags related to this task, the due date, and the importance, and Planup will automatically organize
                the planning. The user can
                choose the time slot during which they want to work. Want to find the best place to work? Planup

            </p>

            <img src="./img/projects/planup/user_flow.png" alt="user flow">

            <h3>Planning of the project</h3>
            <p>
                To plan our work we did multiple documents such as a plan of approach and a feasibility report. The goal
                of these was to be sure that
                the project was feasible by checking if our target would be interested, if it can be done in time or if
                it does already exist. In the plan
                of approach, we explained how we would work as a team. We did a Risk matrix to understand the possible
                risks in the process of the project,
                and a SWOT analysis to see the strengths and weaknesses. Then, we did a stakeholder map to understand the
                different actors that could impact the project.

            </p>

            <h3>Functionalities</h3>
            <p>
                Planup have 4 main functionalities: <br>
                - The planning (to see all the tasks you have to do) <br>
                - Task (to create or edit your task, chose or create tags, and set up the priority) <br>
                - Map (to find the best place to work depending on the task, need inspiration? Go to a park! Need calm?
                Go to this library!) <br>
                - The settings (to set your time slot or import your school roster)
            </p>

            <h3>User test and interview</h3>
            <p>
                To know better our users, I started by interviewing different Dutch and international students. I asked them
                about how they plan they work if they do,
                where they are working, when, and the different hobbies they might have. <br>
                I also did some user tests on my first prototype to check if the concept was adapted to our users. It
                resulted in a few changes for the next version
                of the wireframe.
            </p>

            <h3>Graphical Identity</h3>
            <p>
                We created a simple and clear identity based on 4 colors (red, blue, green, and yellow) We are using
                them for the 4 types of places that are
                silent, comfortable, with food, and inspirational place. Blue is the main color because it
                transmits calm and serenity.
            </p>

            <h3>How to market it?</h3>
            <p>
                For the marketing, we thought of starting by presenting Planup to the Windesheim students. The
                communication would also be done through social
                media thanks to an account that would give organization advice for students. Our map feature is
                presenting you with the best places to work. By having
                a partnership with a cafe or library we can advertise for each other.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                It was the first time that I was working with a multidisciplinary and multicultural team. I learned a lot
                about team management, documentation, and marketing. I was
                able to share my knowledge about design, I had to explain my job and the use of all the steps I was
                doing.
