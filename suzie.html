            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>Our first Workshop, a project in only 5 days. This Quick and Dirty Workshop was obviously stressful and interesting.
                 <br><br>
                 We worked with the Design Sprint method to improve a web site we choose. Our group was composed of 5 members and 
                 we quickly found how to work effectively together. Tom was the one charged to motivate the group, 
                 Paco did all the illustrations, Isaac was in charge of connecting all the pages, Enora wrote the 
                 texts and I had to propose ideas of compositions. 
            </p>

            <h3>The site</h3>
            <p> Enora proposed us the website because she knew the association. Suzie Handicap Animal is an 
                association that welcomed handicapped animals. Stéphanie feed them, cure them and, for some, 
                try to find them a new family.

                <br><br>
                We went through the site and found a lot of colours and communication issues. The home page was okay, 
                but after it, the rest was not really pretty. Nevertheless, the teachers told us to focus our energy 
                on the real objective of the website.
            </p>

            <div class="pictures">
                <img class="pic" src="./img/projects/suzie1.png" alt="website of suzie">
                <img class="pic" src="./img/projects/suzie2.png" alt="website of suzie">
                <img class="pic" src="./img/projects/suzie3.png" alt="website of suzie">
                <img class="pic" src="./img/projects/suzie4.png" alt="website of suzie">
            </div>

            <h3>Finding our Angle</h3>
            <p>
                After discussing with the association, we determined that the main problem to solve was a lot of 
                people wanted to adopt without knowing the consequences of having an animal, nor the expenses related to. 
                So we thought about different way to raise awareness about these animals and show the different solutions to help them.
                <br><br>
                Each one of us had to develop an idea by drawing a Usage scenario. The ideas we developed were: an advertising 
                in a newspaper, an infographic to explain how to adopt an animal and a handicapped animal, a forum to answer to 
                all the questions, and I developed an identity card that would present each animal with a button to share it on 
                the social networks, and another button to make a donation.
                <br><br>
                After this we voted for our favourite but we could not find an agreement for all of us. After a lot of thinking 
                we decided to created a quiz that would supply informations and raise awareness.
            </p>

            <img src="./img/projects/scen2.png" alt="usage scenario">

            <h3>Create a quiz</h3>
            <p>
                Our first step to develop the quiz was to list each question, the information link to it and how we could
                answer to it (checkbox, clickable image, drag...).
                We got our inspiration from the quiz <a href=" http://slaveryfootprint.org/" target="blank_">Slavery
                    Footprint</a> because we wanted to do something funny and not boring.
            </p>

            <h3>The First prototype</h3>
            <p>
                Then we got our first prototype on Figma and run many user tests. But even if people liked our idea, 
                our little jokes and our illustrations, they were not reading the data. So we decided to rework 
                everything in one day.
            </p>

                <img class="pic" src="./img/projects/suzie_proto11.png" alt="first proto">

            </div>

            <h3>Sprint to the end</h3>
            <p>
                We worked harder, Paco did even more illustrations and we re-composed the pages thanks to one of 
                our teacher phrase: "On a web-site you have an infinite space don't stay stuck at the top." 
                Because users didn't know where to look at, we had to isolate each element. We finally finished 
                on time and we are really proud of the result.
            </p>

            <h3>What did I learn</h3>
            <p>
                This workshop learned me a lot about teamwork and how granted to everyone a role can ease the effort. 
                I also learned some skills to take decision through a vote system. 
                Finally, I know now how to use Figma and that when we do something for the second time we 
                can do it faster and better.
            </p>
