            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>During this workshop, we had to create a drone or connected object based on a word. Our word was "confined space". After brainstorming, we
                decided to answer the question: "How to accompany children that are confined in hospitals?". As a matter of fact, children staying a
                time in a hospital far away from their parents are more likely to be under stress, anxiety, and loneliness in addition to their illness.
                Multiple studies have shown that it can have an important impact on the future development of children.
                 </p>

            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Töms is a plush connected with the parent's phone. It accompanies the child during his stay and can be used to comfort and as a
                communication device. The parents can send vocal messages that will be transmitted by Töms. Emojis can also be sent, it 
                will be shown through the shape of their eyes. The child can answer simply by pressing on the paw to record a vocal message.
            
            </p>

            <h3>Why is it a potatoe?</h3>
            <p>We wanted something simple and cute that any child could like. It's why we didn't choose an animal. We all had 5 min to draw our ideas on post-its, then we voted. We stayed on an abstract shape, organic
                round, that's how Töms took the shape of a potato.
            </p>

            <h3>Realisation</h3>
            <p>
                For this project, we realized the prototype with an Arduino card and a few components. We had a pressure sensor 
                to detect when the child pressed on the paw. A speaker is inside the plush for all the sounds, and NeoPixel LEDs are used 
                for the eyes.

            <h3>The sounds</h3>
            <p>
                I have been recording the sound with a Kalimba on Audacity. Everything has been exported on an SD card in the Arduino card.    
            </p>

            <h3>A mobile app for the parents</h3>
            <p>
                In the app, the parents have access to 3 functions. They can record their message and send it to their child. Listen to the message received, organize, and rename them.
                And finally, they can send an emoji to send instant affection.  

            </p>

            <h3>3D Rendering</h3>
            <p>
                We used Blender to have a general view of the final product. Töms has been modelized on Blender and the final video is using 
                free images for more immersion.         

            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                This week was rich in experimentation. I worked mainly on the code and team management which made me touch a little bit on every part of the project.
                 With more time we would have like to developpe a real synchronization between the plus and the app and maybe add more interactions 
                 such as hugging the plush and sending a reaction to the parents. <br>
                 Töms has been presenting in the competition <a href="https://chtiiing-nantes.fr/">Chtiiing</a> from Nantes.
