            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>During this week of workshop, we had to do an arcade game without any screen and with alternative
                controllers.
                We had to find a simple and attractive gameplay. We quickly chose to do something based on the audio.
                And while talking, we had the idea of creating an immersive game placing our players inside a submarine.
            </p>

            <img src="./img/projects/oreilleettorpille/oreillesettorpilles2.gif" alt="gif">

            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>Oreille et Torpille (ear & torpedo) is a 2 player audio game. Each player has a wheel to direct their
                radar,
                a button to shoot torpedos, 3 LEDs to follow their torpedos' stock, and headphones to follow the game.
                The goal is to destroy the other submarine.
                The submarines are static but the radar turn on itself. The player has to listen to the radar, the sound
                gets higher and higher as the radar gets
                closer to the other submarine. When the sound is the highest, the player has to shoot with the button.
                They have to win two rounds to win the game.
                Each round finishes if one of the two players touches the other or if one doesn't have any torpedo left.
            </p>

            <h3>The gameplay</h3>
            <p>
                Our game is based on listening and searching. It requires patience, dexterity, and speed.
            </p>

            <h3>Course of the game</h3>
            <p>
                We placed our arcade game below a table, in the dark. The players are next to each other, separated by a
                curtain. To start the game
                the players have to push their buttons simultaneously two times. Then they hear a voice telling them that
                a certain John is not able to do it
                and they are the ones that need to save the situation, the voice quickly explains how to play and the
                game starts. <br>

                The players don't have any visuals but it's possible to follow the game thanks to the first computer.

            </p>

            <h3>Arduino code</h3>
            <p>
                The data of the encoders and buttons are captured with Arduino and then send to processing. The LEDs are also
                managed thanks to Arduino.


                We had to use a second computer for the player to hear the sounds. That means that both computers are
                linked by the internet. The main code is
                in the first computer on processing. It sends the data in real-time to the second computer to say when
                to play which sound. <br>

            </p>

            <h3>Processing code</h3>
            <p>
                We had to use a second computer for the player to hear the sounds. That means that both computers are
                linked by the internet. The main code is
                in the first computer on processing. It manages the game construction, the scores, and the sounds, and then,
                it sends the data in real-time to
                the second computer to say when to play which sound.
            </p>

            <h3>The sounds</h3>
            <p>
                All of the sounds of the game were done by Paul, he also recorded the voices. Thanks to them the game if
                really immersive. It gives
                precious information to the player such as what he has to do if he is losing or winning he also receive
                the information if the opponent
                shot in the detection zone.

            <h3>The model</h3>
            <p>
                For the arcade model, we did the cockpit of a submarine with a wheel and a button that can be held in the hand.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                This workshop has been the hardest one. We first thought that it would be easy and we pretty soon discovered the complexity 
                and the ambition of our game. I mostly worked on the code, I wasn't sure I would be capable of finishing it but I learned a lot 
                during this week in terms of how to code and the different connections we had to do between Arduino and processing. It was a relief 
                to see that people trully appreciated our game.
